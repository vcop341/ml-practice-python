# Machine Learning Practice with Python

Welcome to **ML Practice with Python** — a repository for hands-on practice and exploration of machine learning concepts using Python. This repo contains sample code, experiments, and example scripts learn implementation of ML techniques and Python programming fundamentals.

## 🧠 What This Repository Covers

This repository includes:
- Example Python scripts illustrating basic and intermediate techniques in Python and ML.
- Object-oriented approaches to structuring code.
- Sample use cases and small experiments.
- Practice code to reinforce learning through implementation rather than theory.

> This project captures my learning journey in machine learning and Python development.

This project uses:
- **Python 3**
- Core Python libraries (standard library)
- (Optional) **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**,
  
#Overview

- The repository was made following the Kaggle introduction to machine learning course and abit of research from the tensorflow youtube channel
